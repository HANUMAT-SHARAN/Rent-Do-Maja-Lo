            What is RMI ? How is it different from monthly rentals I pay to
            Rentomojo ?
          </Text>
          <Text fontSize={14} color="gray.400">
            RMI is a short form for Rentomojo Monthly Installments which are the
            lease payments that you give monthly for usage of the product for a
            stipulated time frame. It depends on factors like market value of
            the product, tenure of service and interest charged. Monthly Rentals
            are different from RMI as it also incorporates over the top expenses
            like insurance, maintenance costs etc over and above RMI costs per
            month. Monthly Rental = RMI + Insurance costs / month + Maintenance
            Costs / Month

          <Text mb="5" fontSize={20}>Why should I rent for 24 months?</Text>
          <Text  fontSize={14} color="gray.400">
            24 months is the most preferred tenure due to the following reasons
            : possibility of shifting is high as an avg consumer today shifts
            once in 2 years. Rentomojo saves you from this burden by providing
            you free relocation within your city or any of the major metro
            cities. Not just that! you get options to upgrade or expand your

            Will I be charged any fee if I return the product before my minimum

          <Text fontSize={14} color="gray.400">
            We do charge a small early closure fee, which is generally a
            multiple of your monthly rent as per your plan. To know more about
            the early closure charges associated with your plan, check out the
            Compare all tenures button.

          <Text fontSize={14} color="gray.400">
            its unfair to charge the same price across tenures as consumers end
            up paying a lot more than whats fair in cases of longer tenures. so
            to make it fair for someone who is committing longer, we reduce
            rentals with tenure similarly to how EMI reduces with tenure.
